--- REACT HOOKS ---

1. USE STATE
- Use states returns an array of 2 elements, the first element is the current State snapshot and thes econd is the state updating function.
- React saves the current state of and does not affects by the re-rendering of the component.
- The state state updating function contains the logic on which the state is updated and then the state is saved by React. 
- So we store the useState() with 2 constants, first one is ofcourse the current state snapshot and the second is the State Updating Function.
- We pass the first constant in the place where we want to use the state snapshot and this is known as 2 Way Binding. That we did with giving the built in value prop(in out case)
- For updating the state we call the function where we want to changes the state, most commonly in events, in our case we did it by passing the State Updating Function in the built onChange prop. 
part 2:
- When we start typing in the title input field we get an error that the typpe number is unctrolled, because the way we called the SUF(State Updating Function) is not correct, it replaces the old state obj with the new state obj whic only contains the title key but not the amount key.
- It is out responsibilty to make sure that we don't lose any data with state updating so we will restroe the old value in the updated state.
- To guarantee that we always have the latest state in the SUF, we can pass an anonymous function to SUF with the previosState as the parameter. //-- I have calles the SUF in title and amount input fields to differentiate--//.
